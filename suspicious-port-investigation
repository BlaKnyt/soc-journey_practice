## Suspicious Port Activity Investigation

## Source IP
-192.168.8.186
  Device is an internal device on a private network because of the address block

## Destination IP
-185.231.212.5
  IP address belongs to a business in Germany according to whatismyipaddress.com
  and ipdata.co.

## Port and Protocol
-Protocol: TCP
-Port: 4444
  The port is dynamic so it could be a metasploit default listener port or an I2P HTTP/S proxy. It
  is a part of a list of registered ports assigned by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers
  Authority). The port can be used for evading detection to mimic legitimate network
  traffic or to hide malicious connnections.

## Analysis
This could be a very severe incident and must be escalated. The IP address is unknown and could come
from an unsafe source. The port can be used as a backdoor to the network.

## Verdict and Recommendations
The device needs to be isolated from the rest of the network to avoid access to any
sensitive on the network. The issue needs to be escalated for further actions.
